Description:

This application is a weather app that detects the location of the user and gets the weather of the city or place the user in through an API 
that then displays the weather in this location.

It also contains a search for the cities so that the user can search for the weather from all over the world by just typing in the cities.

This project was done by Flutter and Dart.

A video is uploaded with a demo of the app.
